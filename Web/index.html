  <!--This is my original script. It work how I intended. The problem is, no matter which button I pressed,
  only the first modal will pop-up. Also, for some reason, it does not work on the first try.
  The modal will only start showing up the second time you pressed the button.-->

  <!--This is the script that I am currently working on to fixed the problem.
  //I did commented a line out to show that all the detail's modals are there and they work,
  I just haven't been able to connect them to the buttons.
  Please comment out the first script before viewing this script.-->
